In order to properly run our program you will need to simply place the 
income_tr.csv in an empty directory with our BashScript file and 
assignment1.py file. Then navigate to this directory using the command
line and type "bash BashScript". You will be prompted to give a value for
K and the script will kick off our Python program.

The ouput.csv containing our results will simply be dumped into the exact
same directory that held the other files. The best way to view this result data
would be using Microsft Excel or other similiar programs.
